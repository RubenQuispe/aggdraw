AggDraw
=======

The AggDraw library provides a python interface on top of
`the AGG library <http://www.antigrain.com/>`_. The library was originally
developed by Fredrik Lundh (effbot), but has since been picked up by various
developers. It is currently maintained by the PyTroll developmer group. The
official repository can be found on GitHub:

https://github.com/pytroll/aggdraw

The original documentation by effbot is
`still available <http://effbot.org/zone/aggdraw-index.htm>`_ but may be out
of date with the current version of the library. Original examples will be
migrated as time is available (pull requests welcome).
